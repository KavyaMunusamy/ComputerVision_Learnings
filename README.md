# ComputerVision_Learnings
A repository documenting my progress in learning computer vision — from image processing basics to deep learning applications, with hands-on code, notes, and experiments.

Computer Vision Learning Journey

This repository is my personal space to document everything I learn about Computer Vision.
It includes:

📘 Fundamentals – image processing, transformations, filters

🤖 Machine/Deep Learning – applying models to vision tasks

🖼 Applications – object detection, segmentation, recognition

📝 Experiments – hands-on practice with OpenCV, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.

💡 Goal: To build a strong foundation, track my progress, and create a resource others learning CV can also use.
